## About InfoLab

Our lab started at <a href="https://www.jbnu.ac.kr">Jeonbuk National University</a> in 2007 and moved to <a href="https://www.cnu.ac.kr">Chungnam National University</a> in 2022. Our research interests are in the field of data management, including query processing and optimization, text processing, and graph search and analytics. Current focus is developing combinatorial algorithms, index structures, and machine learning techniques for efficient searching and matching of graphs in large graph databases. The rendering above depicts a tiny portion of PubChem graph dataset, which has been often used in our research.
